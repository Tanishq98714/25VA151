daughter in college, Jeannette, and teenage twins, Orly and Avi. Also,
they had a twelve- year- old golden retriever, Spirit, who had been Ella’s
walking buddy in the mornings and her cheeriest companion ever since
he’d been a puppy. Now he was old, overweight, completely deaf, and
almost blind; Spirit’s time was coming, but Ella preferred to think he
would go on forever. Then again, that was how she was. She never confronted the death of anything, be it a habit, a phase, or a marriage, even
when the end stood right in front of her, plain and inevitable.</div>
<div>The Rubinsteins lived in Northampton, Massachusetts, in a large
Victorian house that needed some renovation but still was splendid, with
fi ve bedrooms, three baths, shiny hardwood fl oors, a three- car garage,
French doors, and, best of all, an outdoor Jacuzzi. They had life insurance, car insurance, retirement plans, college savings plans, joint bank
accounts, and, in addition to the house they lived in, two enviable apartments: one in Boston, the other in Rhode Island. She and David had
worked hard for all this. A big, busy house with children, elegant furniture, and the wafting scent of homemade pies might seem a cliché to
some people, but to them it was the picture of an ideal life. They had
built their marriage around this shared vision and had attained most, if
not all, of their dreams.</div>
