       <p>They did not live in the same city. Not even on the same continent.
The two of them were not only miles apart but also as diff erent as day
and night. Their lifestyles were so dissimilar that it seemed impossible
for them to bear each other’s presence, never mind fall in love. But it
happened. And it happened fast, so fast in fact that Ella had no time to
realize what was happening and to be on guard, if one could ever be on
guard against love.
Love came to Ella as suddenly and brusquely as if a stone had been
hurled from out of nowhere into the tranquil pond of her life.</p>
