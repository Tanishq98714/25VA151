        <p><b>Breaking the Silence, a rights group formed by veterans of Israel’s armed forces, has blasted Israeli forces for shooting civilians in Gaza for their supposed crossing of the “yellow line”, behind which Israel’s military has redeployed as part of the ceasefire.

Breaking the Silence, which monitors abuses of Palestinians in the occupied territory, said civilians are being shot and killed in Gaza for “crossing a line they don’t even know exists”.

“Let’s be clear: that line exists only on a map, not on the ground,” the group said in a post on social media.

“The same rules of engagement we’ve seen near the GHF ‘aid sites’ and across the Strip: ‘no-go zones’ cross them, and you get shot,” it said, referring to the controversial US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a scandal-plagued organization created to bypass the UN’s established aid delivery infrastructure in the Gaza Strip. Since GHF started operating aid sites in May, there were reports on near-daily shootings at or near GHF sites, starving aid seekers in Gaza and former US mercenaries have spoken out about witnessing gunfire against Palestinian crowds.

Anyone who enters a “no-go zone” is automatically “sentenced to death”, Breaking the Silence added.</b></p>

            <p><b>When a Government wins public trust and comes to power, its first duty is to provide employment and opportunities to the youth, Rahul said.<br>

               On Tuesday (September 23, 2025) claimed that as long as elections are "stolen", unemployment and corruption will continue to rise, and asserted that young people will no longer tolerate "job theft" and "vote theft.
            "But the BJP doesn't win elections honestly — they stay in power by stealing votes and controlling institutions," Mr. Gandhi alleged.

That's why unemployment has reached a 45-year high, he said.

"That's why jobs are declining, recruitment processes have collapsed, and the future of youth is being jeopardised. That's why every exam paper leak and every recruitment is linked to stories of corruption," Mr. Gandhi said.
"The country's youth work hard, dream, and fight for their future. But [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi is solely focused on his PR, getting celebrities to sing praises for him, and billionaire profits. It has become the government's identity to shatter the hopes of the youth and leave them frustrated," the former Congress chief said.

"Now, the situation is changing. India's youth understand that the real fight isn't just for jobs, but against vote theft. Because as long as elections are stolen, unemployment and corruption will continue to rise," he said.

Young people will no longer tolerate "job theft" or "vote theft", Mr. Gandhi asserted.</b> </p>

            <p><b>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden and unexplained death of a baby under one year of age that remains a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it is only confirmed after a full investigation rules out all other causes. While the exact cause is unknown, certain factors increase risk, such as stomach sleeping, soft bedding, and exposure to tobacco smoke. The risk can be greatly reduced by consistently following safe sleep practices, including always placing a baby on their back to sleep on a firm, flat surface and keeping the crib free of blankets and other soft objects.

            <center><img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/10/JKD-TN.jpg?w=640" alt="cruppted" width="500">
            </center>
            <p><b>Tamil Nadu’s batting 45 minutes before the tea break was gloomier than the dark clouds that were hovering around. It eventually brought an early end to their misery against Jharkhand on the second day of their Ranji Trophy clash in Coimbatore. Having let Jharkhand off the hook – they were 157/6 at one stage but went on to score 419 – the day went from bad to worse. In a space of 14 deliveries, on a pitch that offered a bit of seam movement with the new ball and overhead conditions contributing to the challenge, the Tamil Nadu top-order went down like ninepins, much to the horror of the dressing room as they ended the day at 18/5. Jharkhand can register a big win, weather permitting.

“I don’t think they bowled extraordinarily, but it was just our fault the way we got out on a wicket that is really good to the batters. There was slight seam movement and I felt we could have definitely negotiated them a lot better. But unfortunately, we are put in a very precarious situation right now,” skipper N Jagadeesan said.

Having assembled in Coimbatore on September 24, they had two weeks of intense preparations for days like this. With a young batting line-up in place and B Sai Sudharsan and Jagadeesan expected to be away on national commitments, how the young crop will front up to the challenge was the big question. Despite fielding two teams in the Buchi Babu tournament and having their players feature in six rounds of the First Division, it was deemed necessary to hold a pre-season camp for a reason. It is believed by many that the First Division, TN’s fabled nursery, is no longer of much help to their players in their evolution. It is why the camp became a key part of their preparation, where they had centre-wicket training sessions, including simulations, on green tops. Even when they had to hand over the pitch here to the BCCI for the opening fixture, they travelled to Tiruppur to replicate the training. So preparation-wise, they had ticked all boxes.</b>

            <p><b>Erling Haaland scored a hat-trick to pass 50 international goals in record time as Norway cruised to a 5-0 thrashing of Israel, edging closer to qualifying for a first FIFA World Cup finals since 1998.

Before the Saturday night match in Oslo, hundreds of people attended a pro-Palestinian demonstration, chanting “Free Palestine” to protest against Israel’s “genocide” in Gaza, AFP journalists reported.
Manchester City forward Haaland added his second with a powerful header before nodding in to complete his sixth hat-trick for his country with 18 minutes left.

Norway has not played at a major tournament since Euro 2000.

Italy, attempting to reach their first World Cup finals since 2014, moved a step closer thanks to goals from Moise Kean, Mateo Retegui and Pio Esposito in Tallinn.

The Italians move three points ahead of Israel in second place in Group I, which offers a playoff spot.

Italy’s meeting with Israel is expected to be a tense affair, surrounded by pro-Palestinian protests, and only 5,000 tickets have been sold.</b></p>

            <p><b>There have been 53 school shootings in the United States so far this year, as of September 23. Twenty-seven were on college campuses, and 26 were on K-12 school grounds. The incidents left 19 people dead and at least 84 other victims injured, according to CNN’s analysis of events reported by the Gun Violence Archive, Education Week and Everytown for Gun Safety.

CNN cross checks these reports of school shootings against school and police accounts and media reports. All incidents of gun violence are included if they occurred on school property, from kindergartens through colleges/universities, and at least one person was shot, not including the shooter. School property includes but is not limited to, buildings, fields, parking lots, stadiums and buses. Accidental discharges of firearms are included, as long as at least one person is shot, but not if the sole shooter is law enforcement or school security.

In the first year of the pandemic, when schools were closed, there was a major decline in gun violence incidents on school grounds. Since then, recent years saw a stark increase in school shootings, with 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 all setting records since at least 2008. There were at least 83 incidents in 2024, but 2022 was one of the deadliest years, with 47 fatalities, according to CNN’s analysis. That year saw the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, where 19 students and two educators were killed and more than a dozen others were injured.</b></p>

            <p><b>Pope Leo XVI did not go far afield for his first official trip abroad on Tuesday (October 14, 2025) —
                making his way in a motorcade from Vatican City through Rome to visit Italy's President.<br>
                The head of the Catholic Church was driven through the centre of Rome escorted by the presidential guard
                calvary and motorcycles in a slow three-kilometre procession to the Quirinale Palace.<br>

                In an ornate ballroom, a red-and-gold-attired Pope Leo urged Italy to "keep alive your attitude of
                openness and solidarity" towards migrants, calling migration "among the great challenges of our
                time".<br>
                "I express gratitude for the generous assistance this country offers to migrants who increasingly knock
                at its doors, as well as for its efforts in combating human trafficking," said the Pope, while citing
                the need for "constructive integration of newcomers into the values and traditions of Italian
                society".<br>

                Among those in attendance was Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose hard-right government has taken a
                hard line against illegal migration to the country, seeking to restrict departures from North Africa to
                Italy's shores while attempting to increase repatriations.<br>
                The 70-year-old pope thanked Italy for its care for children of Gaza, some 200 of whom have been treated
                in Rome's hospitals since the beginning of the war in 2023. He also defended the Church's position on
                abortion and euthanasia, recalling the need "to uphold and protect life in all its phases, from
                conception to old age, until the moment of death".<br>
                Close diplomatic relations between Italy and Vatican City — the world's smallest state that is
                surrounded by the city of Rome — are governed by the 1929 Lateran Agreements.<br>

                Built in the 16th century, the Quirinal Palace served for three centuries as a papal residence until
                1870, when it became the home of the first king of a unified Italy, Victor Emmanuel II.</b><br>
